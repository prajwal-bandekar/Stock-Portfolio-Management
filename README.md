Stock Portfolio Management: 
This project is an extension of the Wells Fargo Job simulation done on Forage's portal. The aim of the project would be to fully implement a Web application that helps Financial Advisors 
to manage their stock market portfolios easily. They can easily create portfolios and add securities depending upon the wave of the stock market. The backend part of the code is completed which
is implemented using Springboot and MySQL as the Database (Will add more logic in the service layer ifrequired as the project progresses). Currently working on Integrating the REST APIs with 
the frontend, which I am currently using ReactJS to implement for.
